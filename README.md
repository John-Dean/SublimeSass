# SCSS and Sass syntax for Sublime Text 3

- snippets to auto-complete Sass functions
- completions for CSS properties and values

Highlights code using up to date specifications for properties and values to help you catch typos.

Syntax highlighting should be very similar to CSS and LESS (which is maintained in parallel).
